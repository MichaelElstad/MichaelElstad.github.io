Hiking the Colorado trail was foundational in shaping my future. My name while on trail is Shade. Can you tell why?

With 90,000 Ft of elevation gain and 500 miles of trail this was my greatest challenge up to this point.

I will hike the Camino de Santiago 400ish days from now.

Robots will only make these trails better.
